# Plant-Grower
Web App built with JavaScript, HTML, CSS where plants can be grown virtually. 

If you are reading this and see an empty repository it is because I did not save my code on github. I spent months on this project and the code was left on my high school's server and got deleted when I graduated. I was 16 and didn't think about saving my code. I have learned my lesson now and I always save my code.
